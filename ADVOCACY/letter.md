Subject: EFA Vouchers Are Draining Hot Springs Schools — Here’s the Proof

Dear [Name],

I’m a citizen from Arkansas.

Hot Springs School District is being **drained** by:
- **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**
- **Desegregation transfer limits**

Despite **record surpluses**, classrooms face cuts.

I built a full investigative pipeline:

Includes:
• Visual of the drain
• Raw shortfall data
• Queryable database
• Full methodology

This violates **Lake View**.

Can you investigate?

Thank you,
