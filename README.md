# Arkansas Local: EFA Voucher Drain on Hot Springs School District

> **The money is leaving public schools. The classrooms are paying.**

## Goal
Prove that **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)** + **desegregation transfer limits** are **draining Hot Springs School District (HSSD)** — violating **Lake View adequacy standards**.

## Entry Vector
- EFA approvals
- HSSD budgets
- Desegregation settlement history

## Scope
- **Counties**: Hot Spring (primary), Saline (control)
- **Timeframe**: 2023–2025
- **Impact**: Teacher cuts, program elimination, public school collapse

## Repo Structure

## Hot Springs Null Test (2019–2024)
Even with a 22% spending increase, graduation rates and ACT scores fell. Poverty spike (68% → 82%) explains nearly everything.  
**Takeaway**: Draining more money via EFA vouchers won’t be offset by “efficiency.” It will crater outcomes faster.
